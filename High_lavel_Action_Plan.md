# Creating a GPT Model for Hindi

## 1. Data Gathering
Gather a large dataset in Hindi. The data should ideally contain all forms of Hindi text, from books and news to conversational transcripts and social media posts.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
This involves removing unnecessary parts from the text like HTML tags and normalizing the text, which can include lowercasing, removing punctuations, and resolving abbreviations. Tokenization is another crucial part.

## 3. Training a Language Model
The processed data can then be used to train a language model. GPT is based on the Transformer architecture, and its code is open-source and available on GitHub. However, training such a model from scratch requires a lot of computational power.

## 4. Fine-tuning
After training, the model can be fine-tuned on a smaller specific dataset, like a dataset of Hindi news articles if the final goal is to generate news articles.

## 5. Evaluation and Improvement
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Perplexity, BLEU score, etc. If the performance is not satisfactory, the model is improved by tuning its hyperparameters or increasing the training data, and the process is repeated.


I am working on Two things

# A) Data Gathering

## 1- Hindi Books (With English Translations if Available)
Gathering data from Hindi books is an excellent way to understand the formal and colloquial usage of language. If these books also have English translations available, it can be beneficial in building a translation model.

## 2- Hindi Songs (With English Translations if Available)
Lyrics from Hindi songs can provide insight into the colloquial usage of the language, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. Songs with English translations can assist in understanding context and connotation in the translation process.

## 3- Movies Subtitles in Hindi (With English Translations if Available)
Subtitles from Hindi movies are a rich source of conversational Hindi. They can help the model understand dialogue-style text and informal language usage. If English translations of these subtitles are available, they can be used for a translation model.

## 4- Hindi Songs (With English Translations if Available)
(Note: This point seems to be a repetition of point 2)

## 5- Hindi Poems (With English Translations if Available)
Hindi poems can provide insight into the more artistic and traditional use of the language. They can help the model learn complex sentence structures and rich vocabulary. Poems with English translations can help in understanding nuanced language usage.

## 6. Expanding the Data Pool
As the process evolves, there may be a need to add more data to improve the model's understanding and generation of text. This could be through new forms of data like speech-to-text transcriptions, user-generated content, or other forms of colloquial and formal Hindi texts.

## 7. Scraping the Internet for Data
The internet can be a valuable resource for gathering data. Websites, blogs, news articles, and social media posts can provide a variety of Hindi language content. Web scraping, however, must be done responsibly, respecting copyright laws and website terms of service.


# B) User interface, similar to ChatGPT, provides the user with a platform to write prompts. 

## 1. Toggle Switch for Script Choice
The user interface features a toggle switch, allowing users to choose whether they want to write their Hindi prompts in Devanagari or Roman script.

## 2. Mixed Script Input
The interface also supports mixed script input (Hinglish), where users can write in a combination of Hindi and English within the same prompt.

## 3. Autocorrect and Understanding in Both Scripts
HindiGPT, the underlying model, has autocorrect capabilities for both Devanagari and Roman scripts to better understand the user's input.

## 4. Dual Script Responses
Based on the user's chosen script from the toggle switch or button, HindiGPT can provide responses in either Devanagari or Roman script.
